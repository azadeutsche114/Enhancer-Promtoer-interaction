Implementing EPI-DLMH (Enhancer-Promoter Interaction with Deep Learning and Matching Heuristic) to predict enhancer-promoter interactions 
requires a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and training data with DNA sequences labeled as enhancers, promoters, and 
non-interacting pairs. While the exact EPI-DLMH model architecture might not be publicly available due to proprietary considerations, I can 
guide you on setting up a similar model structure based on deep learning techniques that involve CNNs, recurrent layers (like GRUs), and attention mechanisms.
